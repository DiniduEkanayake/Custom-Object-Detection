# Custom Object Detection using YOLOv3, OpenCV, and Python

This project demonstrates how to perform custom object detection using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model integrated with OpenCV and Python. YOLOv3 is widely recognized for its ability to detect multiple objects within an image in real-time, making it ideal for applications where speed and accuracy are critical.

## Key Features
- **Custom Object Detection**: Train YOLOv3 on your own dataset to detect specific objects of interest. This is particularly useful for specialized tasks such as detecting rare objects or creating a tailored detection system for a specific environment.
- **OpenCV Integration**: Utilize OpenCV's `dnn` module to load and execute the YOLOv3 model. OpenCV is a powerful library that simplifies image processing tasks, including reading and manipulating images, drawing bounding boxes, and displaying the detection results.
- **Python Implementation**: The project is implemented entirely in Python, making it easy to integrate with other Python-based machine learning and data processing tools. Pythonâ€™s simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries enable efficient development and experimentation.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Leverage the speed of YOLOv3 to process video streams or real-time camera feeds, allowing for live object detection applications such as surveillance, robotics, or interactive systems.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Modify the YOLOv3 configuration files to adapt the network architecture to your specific needs. This includes adjusting the number of classes, fine-tuning layers, and setting detection thresholds.

## Module Overview
- **`yolo/`**: This directory contains the YOLOv3 configuration files (`.cfg`), class names (`.names`), and the pre-trained weights (`.weights`).
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for various tasks:
  - **`train.py`**: Script to train the YOLOv3 model on your custom dataset.
  - **`detect.py`**: Perform object detection on images or videos.
  - **`utils.py`**: Utility functions for processing images, drawing bounding boxes, and handling YOLO outputs.
- **`data/`**: Contains your dataset, including images and labels, organized for training.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the scripts.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository, install the required dependencies, and follow the setup instructions in the documentation to train your custom YOLOv3 model or run object detection on existing models.

This project is designed for developers, researchers, and hobbyists interested in building custom object detection systems with minimal setup and maximum flexibility.
